# E-Commerce Store

## Introduction

Welcome to my fifth project. This project is an e-commerce store to promote a healthy lifestyle. Users will be able to purchase clothes and nutrients from this website. This project will use languages and frameworks such as Django, Python, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

In this project, I will set up an authentication mechanism and provide access to the site's data for users to purchase a range of products.

The admin of the website will also have the ability to use all CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

A live website can be found [here](https://vim-vigor.herokuapp.com/).

# 1. UX

[Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

As a gym goer I wanted to create a website that sells healthy items as well as training gear. Users will be able to access a blog which will promote health. This store will mainly focus on simplicity and user experience for the customers.

This project will showcase a range of products for users to purchase. The site will be clear and easily accessible. The best e-commerce stores display simply but clear navigation around the site, with an intuitive design.

Frequent User Goals

### User Expectations:
The website should have a simple user interface, with the navigation to each section clear and concise.

-   The user interface is easy to navigate.
-   The website is responsive on all devices.
-   To be able to see a clear selection of products.
-   Easily view the total of the basket before making any payment.
-   The website provides responsive feedback for any actions, for example when adding a product to the basket.

### User Stories
Throughout the project, I used the GitHub projects board to log all user stories as my project management tool. This helped me keep the focus on the necessary tasks as I would move them to the "in progress lane" as I'm working on the story. I would then move them to the "done" lane once the story has been completed. I would add new user stories during the project to keep track of the tasks that had to be done.

# 1.2. Structure

[Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

It is really important to include responsive design in this project as many users are using different devices (mobile, tablet, laptop/PC). This gives the user the best experience on their device.

- Responsive on all device sizes
- Easy navigation through labelled buttons
- Footer at the bottom of the each page that links to the social media websites, newsletter subscription form and business pages.
- All elements will be consistent including font size, font family, colour scheme.

# 4. Testing

[Go to the top](#table-of-contents)
### Responsive Tools
I used [Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is) to make sure that all my pages are responsive to all devices.

### W3C Validator Tools

#### HTML:
I used [W3C Markup](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input+with_options) to check for any errors within the HTML pages.

I had occurring errors that were related to Django, for these instances I have chosen to ignore them.
![HTML_errors_example](documentation_assets/images/html_error_example.png)

#### CSS:
I used [W3C CSS Validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to check for any errors within all my CSS stylesheets.

I had one error in my checkout CSS file, however, I have chosen to ignore this as this code is similar to the Code Institute CSS:
![css_validation_error](documentation_assets/images/static_css_error.png)

I had no errors in my root level CSS file:
![css_validation](documentation_assets/images/static_css_no_error.png)

### JavaScript:
I used [JS Hint](https://jshint.com/) to check for any errors within all my JavaScript script files. JS Hint showed warnings a few warnings but no errors.

I had no errors in my JavaScript files:
![javascript_validation](documentation_assets/images/javascript_validation.png)

### Python:
I used the python3 -m flake8 command within GitPod to check for any errors within my Python files. The validator showed multiple "line too long" errors. This was rectified by adding each statement as a new line.

There were also "line too long" errors within my settings.py file but I have chosen to ignore these as this is a very important file.

## Manual Testing

I have tested my site on Safari and google chrome on multiple devices.

These include:
-   iPhone X
-   iPhone XS Max
-   iPad Pro
-   MacBook Pro
