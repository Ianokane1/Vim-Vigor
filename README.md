# E-Commerce Store

## Introduction

Welcome to my fifth project. This project is an e-commerce store to promote a healthy lifestyle. Users will be able to purchase clothes and nutrients from this website. This project will use languages and frameworks such as Django, Python, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

In this project, I will set up an authentication mechanism and provide access to the site's data for users to purchase a range of products.

The admin of the website will also have the ability to use all CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

A live website can be found [here](https://vim-vigor.herokuapp.com/).
